# 🃏 **Three Card Poker – QuantQuest Edition**

**Description:**
A fast-paced game where both you and the dealer are dealt 3 cards from a standard 52-card deck. Your goal is to beat the dealer’s hand by betting smartly across up to 5 rounds in a game session.

---

**Hands:**
Hands are ranked by highest cards. The winner is determined by comparing cards from highest to lowest in order:

* Example: `K 10 2` beats `K 9 5`
* No special hands (like pairs or straights) — highest individual cards win.

---

**Gameplay:**
Each game session has **5 rounds**.
In each round:

* You place a base bet to see your hand.
* You can then **fold** (lose base bet) or **bet again** to play the round.
* The dealer's hand is revealed only if you play.

📌 **Important:** Cards are **not returned to the deck**, so you can use memory and probability to improve your chances in later rounds.
