# **N Dice**

## **Game Description**

In **N Dice**, the number of dice `n` is randomly chosen by the server at the beginning of each round.

1. The player starts by making an empty POST request to the game endpoint to fetch the number of dice `n` for that round.
2. After receiving the value of `n`, the player bets on a number between `n` and `6 * n` (the minimum and maximum possible sum of `n` dice).
3. The house rolls `n` dice.
4. If the sum of the dice matches the playerâ€™s guess, the player wins **20 times** their bet; otherwise, they lose their bet.
