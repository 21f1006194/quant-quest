# Sniper Shot

Step into the boots of a regiment commander in a high-stakes test of intuition, leadership, and probability. You command a squad of 27 elite snipers, each taking a shot at their designated target under your watch. Your mission isn't to pull the trigger, but to anticipate performance — **place your wager on how many snipers will hit their mark**.

Each sniper fires independently, and success is never guaranteed. Will your judgment prove sharp under pressure, or will uncertainty cloud your call?

Your goal: **Predict the total number of successful hits** across all 27 snipers. Think tactically, weigh the odds, and trust your instincts — the outcome of this operation depends on your ability to read the battlefield from afar.

Are you ready to lead with precision?
