## 🎯 Spinner Winner

**Spinner Winner** is a strategic spin-the-wheel game where each segment has a different size and payout. Your goal is to choose the segment with the best **risk–reward balance**, not just the one with the highest chance.

### 🕹️ How to Play

1. Start a game to get a randomly generated wheel (colors, segment sizes, and payouts).
2. Calculate the **expected value (EV)** for each segment:
   `EV = Probability × Payout`
3. Choose a color, place your bet, and spin the wheel.
4. Win if the wheel lands on your chosen color — get the payout shown!
