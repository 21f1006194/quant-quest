## ðŸŽ¯ Lucky Probability Spin

### Game Description
A spin-the-wheel game with unequal-sized segments. Players bet on a color segment. The rarer the segment, the higher the payout.

### Segments
| Color   | Angle | Probability | Payout |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Red     | 36Â°    | 10%         | 100    |
| Blue    | 54Â°    | 15%         | 75     |
| Green   | 90Â°    | 25%         | 50     |
| Yellow  | 108Â°   | 30%         | 25     |
| Purple  | 72Â°    | 20%         | 40     |

### Expected Value (EV)
EV = (0.10Ã—100) + (0.15Ã—75) + (0.25Ã—50) + (0.30Ã—25) + (0.20Ã—40) = **49.25 points**

### Statistical Edge
The game teaches non-uniform probability. Smaller segments mean higher rewards but lower chances. It visualizes expected value and decision-making under uncertainty.
