        Participants engage in casino-style games (multiple games at different levels)  inspired by probability and statistics (e.g., roulette, coin tosses, Monty Hall), but these games will have a mathematical/statistical loophole or edge.
        <br>
        Each participant will start with a fixed virtual capital, which they can use to play the game (place bets). They are supposed to  identify statistical edges, develop algorithms to exploit them, and manage risk effectively.
        <br>
        Participants can play each game N time (N trialsâ€“ different for different games), on each trial their bets are placed via an API, and players manage risk by choosing their risk percentage
